For this assignment, you will create a home page for a movie review called Flick Picks using responsive web design. You will begin by creating a comp in Photoshop for the desktop view of the home page only. Once you have developed the imagery and layout, you will code the pages using HTML5 and CSS3.


**About Flick Picks:**

**Description**
Flick Picks is an online movie review website. It differs from sites like rotten tomatoes and moviefone in that the user can specify the reviews he/she reads by choosing specific reviewer profile criteria. For example, a user could choose to see only reviews from male university students between 19 and 21 years of age who live in Texas.

**Assignment Criteria:**
The focus here is on responsive design. By using responsive web design, your site will look good and function correctly on desktops, laptops, tablets, and smart phones.

As you can see, it would be a daunting task to make different layouts for each specific device. Instead, we will make several “generic” designs that will fit most displays. The resolutions should include the 400px portrait width of smartphones, 600px portrait width of tablets, 960px landscape width of tablets (and typical netbook resolutions) as well as various desktop monitor resolutions.

You must address the following criteria:

- For desktop/laptop viewing, use a three-column, fluid layout. The wrapper should be centered in the browser.
- You must create a custom logo that appears at the top of each layout.
- You must create page copy for each movie advertised. Be creative. Research other sites with similar content for ideas.
- Include images. Movie images are readily available on IMDB, etc.
- Like other page elements, the navigation should adjust to fit each format. Remember, navigation is very important to the functionality of the site and should be easily usable. The navigation must look like it works but all links go back to the home page.
- The site must have a favicon.
- The site must include a log-in link, which doesn’t work (it’s just a graphic)
- The site must include a search bar, which doesn’t work (it’s just a graphic)
