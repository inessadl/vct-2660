This repository is for the assignments of the Introduction to Interactive Media class (VCT 2260 - BGSU). The class consists of principles of web design, focused on HTML5 and CSS3 (see syllabus). All pages are static and have "the final layout", which means they show just with HTML and CSS what is supposed to be created also with JavaScript and/or PHP. All the layout were based on the requirements, that are described in the README file of each project.
